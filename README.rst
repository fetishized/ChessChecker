 Usage
==============
---------------------------------
 Using a custom namelist
---------------------------------
If you're cloning/downloading this program from GitHub, place the namelist in the same folder as the program.
When the prompt shows up, you'll type "namelist.txt", of course substituting "namelist" for the name of your namelist. You must include the file extension.

If you're installing this using pip, make sure you type the path of the namelist. Relative path won't work.
